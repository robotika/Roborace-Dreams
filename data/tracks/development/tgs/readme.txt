You can drive this track in the opposite direction:
Rename tgs-rev.xml to tgs.xml (save the original tgs.xml FIRST!)
Then run speed-dreams.

The file tgs.ac was created by running
./bin/sd2-trackgen -c development -n tgs -a
You may have to change permissions on the files or directory.

The same .ac file is used in both directions.
