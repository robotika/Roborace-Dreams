Speed Dreams Requirements
-------------------------
Torcs was told to need at least a 600MHz CPU (800MHz recommended), 128 MB RAM (256MB
recommended) and an OpenGL 1.3 capable graphics card with 32MB RAM (64MB recommended).
You'll probably need more now, as Speed Dreams is constantly improving visual rendering. 
Make sure that you have installed the latest sound and graphics drivers.

Running Speed Dreams
--------------------
- Read the "How-To Drive" on www.torcs.org
  (http://torcs.sourceforge.net/index.php?name=Sections&op=viewarticle&artid=10).
- Press F1 anytime to get help (do it as well during the ride to learn about the options).
- Read the FAQ to learn about split screen multiplayer and more.

Getting Help
------------
First have a look at the available documentation on speed-dreams.sourceforge.net.
If you find no solution for the problem learn in the FAQ how and where to report
a problem. The best place to get help is the speed-dreams-users mailing list, 
you find the link on speed-dreams.sourceforge.net.

Car Setups
----------
For the player driver, the default car parameters are located in the files
"<install>/drivers/human/car*.xml" depending on the car used. 
You can have your own customized version of these files by copying them
to <My documents>/speed-dreams.settings/drivers/human/car*.xml
and changing them with a text editor ; for more information look into the
robot tutorial chapter 5 (http://www.berniw.org/torcs/robot/ch5/properties.html).

Creating Tracks
---------------
There is a new track editor in development (by Mart Kelder) :
have a look at Speed Dreams SVN repository (in the subprojects directory).
